## TODO:

- What is relative or an absolute path in unix shell
- basic understanding or lexers

## Parts of a shell Program

The shell implementation is divided into three parts:

- **The Parser**
- **The Executor**
- **Shell Subsystems**

### The Parser

The parser is the software component that reads the command line, and puts it into a data structure
**Command Table** that will store the commands that will be executed.

### The Executor

The executor will take the command table generated by the parser, and for every command, it will create a new process.

It will also if necessary create pipes for communication between process.

It will redirect the standard input, output and error is there are any redirections.

Type of redirections:

- `>`: redirect the output of the command to an _outfile_

```bash
    ls -la > outfile
```

- `<`: input of the first command is redirected from the _infile_

```bash
    cat < infile
```

Example of a sequence of commands with redirections

```bash
cat | wc -l > tmp < hello
```

Shell redirect the content of _hello_ file as an input to the `cat` command.

`wc -l` uses the output of `cat` as an input, then output will be redirected to the tmp file

- if **tmp** exist:
  -> It's content will be overwritten
- if **tmp** does not exist:
  -> tmp file would be created, with the redirected content

## Shell Subsystems

There are other subsystems that complete the shell which are:

- **Environment Variables**: The shell should be able to _set_, _expand_ and _print_ environment variables
  of the form `$VAR` or `${VAR}`

- **Wildcards**: The wildcards of the form `*` or `a*a` should be expanded to all the files that match them in the local directory
  and multiple directories.

- **Subshells**: Not required but why not!!, `command` or `$(command)`
  commands are executed in a subshell, it's output is sent as input to the shell.

## Using Lex and Yacc to implement the Parser

we will use two UNIX tools to implement a parser: **Lex** and **Yacc**. These tools are used to
implement _compilers_, _interpreters_, and _preprocessors_.

Lexer: _Lexical analysis_, _tockenization_ is the process of converting a sequence of _characters_ into a meaningful sequence of lexical tokens

Yacc: yet another compiler compiler is a parser generator for compilers
